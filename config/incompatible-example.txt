To Set Incompatible Layers Goto -> /project_folder/src/config.js:

  1. On line 98, define the incompatible layers in the following way...
  2. Assume The Layer Order is Background->Middle->Top
  3. The Layer that comes first in the order should be the key and the incompatible following layer should be the value. (You can use list to define multiple such layers). 
  4. The Key and Value should be clean.To set incompatible items, in the incompatible object, use the layer/images cleanName (the name without rarity weight, or .png extension) as a key, and create an array of incompatible layer names (again, clean names). Layers that have space or hyphens in their names should be wrapped in quotes
